Identify if data is missing or inconsistent.

There are two possible cases and you might see one or both of them.

1. Identify the missing fields from the pod log
+
include::partial$runbooks/find_check_logs.adoc[]

2. Look at the last line of the log.
+
[source]
----
5 missing, 7 inconsistent entries found.
----

3. Continue with the steps for the missing data or the inconsistent data where the count is greater than 0.

=== Inconsistent data

Inconsistent fact entries can be caused by changes to the `during` time ranges of the corresponding dimension after facts were already created.
The entries should be deleted and re-created.

1. Connect to the database
+
include::partial$runbooks/connect_to_postgres.adoc[]

2. Delete the inconsistent fact entries
+
[source,sql]
----
begin;

with to_delete as (
  select facts.id from facts
    inner join <TABLE> on facts.<FOREIGN KEY> = <TABLE>.id <1>
    inner join date_times on facts.date_time_id = date_times.id
    where false = <TABLE>.during @> date_times.timestamp
)
delete from facts where id in (select id from to_delete);
----
<1> Replace `<TABLE>` with the table name of the dimension as shown in the log.
Replace `<FOREIGN KEY>` with the foreign key of the dimension.
It's the dimension name in singular with `_id` appended.
`queries` becomes `query_id` for example.

3. Commit the changes
+
[source,sql]
----
commit;
----

4. See xref:runbooks/APPUiOCloudReportingDatabaseBackfillingFailed.adoc[] on how to backfill the database in the time range of the deleted facts.

=== Missing data

1. Identify the missing fields from the pod log
+
include::partial$runbooks/find_check_logs.adoc[]

2. Lookup the missing identifiers
+
Use the content of the field `source` as a starter.
Use https://portal.appuio.cloud to look up the organization, and then use https://control.vshn.net to identify a matching customer.
Once a matching customer was found, look it up in https://erp.vshn.net.
Search for the customer's accounting contact.
It's named `<customer name>, Accounting`.
Fall back to the main customer record if no dedicated accounting contact could be found.
The ID you need is the `Odoo Partner ID`.

3. Complete the data
+
Connect with the billing database.
+
include::partial$runbooks/connect_to_postgres.adoc[]
+
Update the records.
+
[source,sql]
----
UPDATE tenants set target = <ID from ERP> where id = <UUID from pod log>
----

4. Trigger a new check
+
[source,bash]
----
name="check-missing-manual-$($(command -v gdate || command -v date) +%s)"
kubectl --as cluster-admin -n appuio-reporting create job --from=cronjob/check-missing "${name}"
kubectl -n appuio-reporting logs "job/${name}"
----
+
Continue with step 2 should there be more data missing.

5. Clean up
+
Remove all failed check-missing jobs to clear the alert.
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n appuio-reporting delete $(kubectl -n appuio-reporting get job -l cron-job-name=check-missing --field-selector status.successful=0 -o name)
----
